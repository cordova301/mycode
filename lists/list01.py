   Lists are created with square brackets, [], and organize data into an ordered series.
   Each item in the series is given an index position starting at 0. Data will remain in that position until an instruction to (re)move it.
   
   L[0] - returns the first item in the list
   L[-1] - returns the last item in the list
   
   L.append(item) - adds an item to the end of the list'''
